# ukps-domains
A public, machine-readable list of UK public sector domains used for user identities and email, published in JSON with supporting schemas.

## Purpose

This list focuses on organisational domains - the domains people use for email and identity.  
Service, product, and campaign subdomains aren't included.

Each record includes the domain, organisation name, organisation type, and relevant identifiers.

## Scope

Covers domains for:
- Central government
- Local authorities
- NHS and health bodies
- Emergency services
- NDPBs and ALBs
- Devolved administrations

> **_NOTE:_** If an organisation already publishes authoritative domain data, this repo will reference that source instead.

## Adding or Updating Domains

If you'd like to propose a change:
- Open an Issue (preferred) with the domain and organisation details, or
- Submit a PR directly using the template.

Discussions are available for queries or edge cases.
